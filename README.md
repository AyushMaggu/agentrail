AgentRail is a step towards new blend of automated browsing powered by Selenium and combined with the intelligence and conversational ability of Large Language Models    
AgentRail not only automates browsing Indian Train Schedule on MakeMyTrip website but it also allows users to ask much more flexible and complicated queries using LLM Agents that can never be immediately solved by a traditional website based experiene.
AgentRail is currently hosted as a Streamlit App allowing users to ask queries regarding Indian Railways and even book tickets with the power of conversation rather than browse-click.
